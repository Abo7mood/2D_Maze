# Story of this game 📖
--------------------------

I created this game for a school in Turkey that needed me to gamify their educational content. At that time, I was 19 years old, and the goal was to make learning more engaging through a fun maze game.

The game was designed to challenge students’ problem-solving abilities and test their mathematical skills after completing the maze. Once players win, they are prompted with a random math question to reinforce learning in a playful and interactive way.

This project was an exciting opportunity to combine game development with educational concepts, and it remains one of my favorite experiences as a game developer.
