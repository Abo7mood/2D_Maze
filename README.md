## Story of this game 📚
--------------------------

I created this game for a **school in Turkey** that needed me to gamify their educational content. At that time, I was **19 years old**, and the goal was to make learning more engaging through a fun maze game.

The game was designed to challenge students’ **problem-solving abilities** and test their **mathematical skills** after completing the maze. Once players win, they are prompted with a **random math question** to reinforce learning in a playful and interactive way.

This project was an **exciting opportunity** to combine **game development with educational concepts**, and it remains one of my **favorite experiences** as a game developer. 🎮
